# Daily Journal

This Next.js app is designed to serve as a daily journal for the current user. The project itself serves as a smaller portion of a larger health and fitness app.

NOTE: Future plans for this app include saving journals in a database based on the logged in user. The JSON file is only temporary for testing purposes.
